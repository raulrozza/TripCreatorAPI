# Trip Creator with Go

This project was developed under Rocketseat's Next Level Week Journey, to test an API development with the Go language.

The Trip Creator API provides interfaces to create and update a new trip, invite participants to it and plan the trip with friends.
The project uses conecpts such as **API validation**, **email sending**, **code generation** with **tern** and **sqlc**, and other basic concepts to experiment with this language.

This was a nice start up project to understand some technologies, patterns used with the language and usual packages of the Go ecosystem.

PS: Only two of all the previewed methods were implemented during the classes.
